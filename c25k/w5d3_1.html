    Day: W5D3 (Failed)
    <br/><br/>
    There are 3 different runs this week: Run 1: a brisk 5-minute walk, then 5 minutes of running, 3 minutes of walking, 5 minutes of running, 3 minutes of walking and 5 minutes of running. Run 2: a brisk 5-minute walk, then 8 minutes of running, 5 minutes of walking and 8 minutes of running. Run 3: a brisk 5-minute walk, then 20 minutes of running, with no walking.    <br/><br/>

    Thoughts:
    <p>
      I was suppose to run for 20 minutes straight. Could only get 14 minutes before my lungs and legs gave out. It was a little win, I did the loop around IS5 without stopping for once. It was also super hot with the sun out and I played basketball the day before. I will reattempt this day or maybe even repeat W5D2 depending on how I'm feeling.

    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I should slow down the pace of my jogs.</li>
      <li>Invest in a stopwatch instead of iPhone.</li>
      <li>Look into stretches or icing to prevent pain</li>
      <li>Dislike bring the phone with me during the runs</li>
      <li>Wear less layers, it gets hot homie</li>
      <li>Get more sleep!</li>
    </ul>
