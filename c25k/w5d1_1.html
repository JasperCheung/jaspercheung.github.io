    Thoughts:
    <p>
     First day I have failed. Will retry the day again. Very sad. My legs felt dead after the 2nd 5 minute run.

    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I should slow down the pace of my jogs.</li>
      <li>Invest in a stopwatch instead of iPhone.</li>
      <li>Look into stretches or icing to prevent pain</li>
      <li>Dislike bring the phone with me during the runs</li>
      <li>Wear less layers, it gets hot homie</li>
      <li>Get more sleep!</li>
      <li>Cut Hair!</li>
    </ul>
