    Day: W9D1
    <br/><br/>For your 3 runs in week 9, you will begin with a brisk 5-minute walk, then 30 minutes of running.

    Thoughts:
    <p>30 minutes straight and last week. Seemed like forever ago when I started c25k. It was difficult again I'm running too quickly and losing my breath early in the run.</p>
    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I should slow down the pace of my jogs.</li>
      <li>Invest in a stopwatch instead of iPhone.</li>
      <li>Look into stretches or icing to prevent pain</li>
      <li>Dislike bring the phone with me during the runs</li>
      <li>Wear less layers, it gets hot homie</li>
      <li>Get more sleep!</li>
    </ul>
