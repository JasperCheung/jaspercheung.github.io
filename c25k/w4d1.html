    Thoughts:
    <p>
      Um. That was insane. Def the hardest workout by far in terms of progression from the previous week. The 5 minute portions were almost impossbile and i ran out of breathe really quickly on both. I tried running slower but my legs were getting really heavy. Also i have to cut my hair. I'm really sweating and it's annoying with longer hair.

    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I should slow down the pace of my jogs.</li>
      <li>Invest in a stopwatch instead of iPhone.</li>
      <li>Look into stretches or icing to prevent pain</li>
      <li>Dislike bring the phone with me during the runs</li>
      <li>Wear less layers, it gets hot homie</li>
      <li>Get more sleep!</li>
      <li>Cut Hair!</li>
    </ul>
