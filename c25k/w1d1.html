    Thoughts:
    <p>
      First day starting the Couch to 5k program. Though it would be easy, more challenging than I thought. I jogged a little less than I usually do, but the interval switching allowed me to keep my heart rate up longer. Did most of the run in my mask. I hope I'll make more progress sticking to a program instead of just freeballing it. Been jogging for a couple of months now and haven't seen much progress.
    </p>
    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I should slow down the pace of my jogs.</li>
      <li>Invest in a stopwatch instead of iPhone.</li>
    </ul>
