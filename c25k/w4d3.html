    Thoughts:
    <p>
      Took two rest days. Made this day easier than the previous two. First time it rained doing C25K, i really liked running in the rain during the run. But didn't like the hassle of the cleanup after. Going to try and avoid the rainnnnnn.

    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I should slow down the pace of my jogs.</li>
      <li>Invest in a stopwatch instead of iPhone.</li>
      <li>Look into stretches or icing to prevent pain</li>
      <li>Dislike bring the phone with me during the runs</li>
      <li>Wear less layers, it gets hot homie</li>
      <li>Get more sleep!</li>
      <li>Cut Hair!</li>
    </ul>
