    Thoughts:
    <p>
      It was a little bit easier than the first two days. I'm proud of myself that I went on a "morning" run. Did not feel as sore as the 2nd day but was very sleepy. Was a little absent minded and didn't end and start the intervals as strictly as the program. But made it up in the end. Getting a little better at slowing down the pace of my jogs but I'll just keep working on it. Proud of myself for finishing the week.

    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I should slow down the pace of my jogs.</li>
      <li>Invest in a stopwatch instead of iPhone.</li>
      <li>Look into stretches or icing to prevent pain</li>
      <li>Dislike bring the phone with me during the runs</li>
    </ul>
