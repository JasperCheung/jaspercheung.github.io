    Day: W2D1
    <br/><br/>
    Description: For your 3 runs in week 2, you will begin with a brisk 5-minute walk. After this, you will alternate 1-and-a-half minutes of running with 2 minutes of walking, for a total of 20 minutes.

    Thoughts:
    <p>
      It hurts. A lot more difficult. I think maybe I didn't get enough sleep. It was too hot. Running out of breathe super quickly. RUN SLOWER PAPI.

    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I should slow down the pace of my jogs.</li>
      <li>Invest in a stopwatch instead of iPhone.</li>
      <li>Look into stretches or icing to prevent pain</li>
      <li>Dislike bring the phone with me during the runs</li>
      <li>Wear less layers, it gets hot homie</li>
      <li>Get more sleep</li>
    </ul>
