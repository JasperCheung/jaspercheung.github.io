    Thoughts:
    <p>
      Didn't feel ready for the 25 minute run so ran day 2 again. I ran too fast got out of breath way too quickly. Running along FDR is really nice. Also ran shirtless which was nice as well.

    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I should slow down the pace of my jogs.</li>
      <li>Invest in a stopwatch instead of iPhone.</li>
      <li>Look into stretches or icing to prevent pain</li>
      <li>Dislike bring the phone with me during the runs</li>
      <li>Wear less layers, it gets hot homie</li>
      <li>Get more sleep!</li>
    </ul>
