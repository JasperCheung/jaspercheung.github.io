    Thoughts:
    <p>
    Took two rest days because I didn't get enough sleep. Harder than the first day for sure. Ran out of breath v quickly. Legs got sore rather quickly as well.

    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I should slow down the pace of my jogs.</li>
      <li>Invest in a stopwatch instead of iPhone.</li>
      <li>Look into stretches or icing to prevent pain</li>
      <li>Dislike bring the phone with me during the runs</li>
      <li>Wear less layers, it gets hot homie</li>
      <li>Get more sleep!</li>
    </ul>
