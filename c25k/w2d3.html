    Thoughts:
    <p>
      First time taking two rest days. I had a good night's sleep, felt good. The workout felt much better. Didn't get winded as easily, though my legs are still getting tired. Gives me a bit of confidence that the other runs this week were difficult due to rest and sleep and not my ability.

    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I should slow down the pace of my jogs.</li>
      <li>Invest in a stopwatch instead of iPhone.</li>
      <li>Look into stretches or icing to prevent pain</li>
      <li>Dislike bring the phone with me during the runs</li>
      <li>Wear less layers, it gets hot homie</li>
      <li>Get more sleep!</li>
    </ul>
