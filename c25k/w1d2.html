    Thoughts:
    <p>
     Just as difficult as the first day. Came across a reddit post that mentioned you should not be getting winded during these workouts. Still having trouble slowing down my pace and getting winded. Also a lot more pain than the first day, have to be careful about injuries. I did the workout at 11:00am. Going on a run in the morning is something I should be doing more.

    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I should slow down the pace of my jogs.</li>
      <li>Invest in a stopwatch instead of iPhone.</li>
      <li>Look into stretches or icing to prevent pain</li>
    </ul>
