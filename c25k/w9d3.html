    Day: W9D3
    <br/><br/>For your 3 runs in week 9, you will begin with a brisk 5-minute walk, then 30 minutes of running.
    <br/><br/>
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210410215943/https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/couch-to-5k-week-by-week/">Program</a>
    <br/><br/>
    Thoughts:
    <p>finished the run. finally done with the program. last day was difficult. I plan on continuing to run really rewarding to finish this. Probably continue to do 30 minute runs for a while. YAYAYAYAYAYAY! IM DONE.</p>
    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I should slow down the pace of my jogs.</li>
      <li>Invest in a stopwatch instead of iPhone.</li>
      <li>Look into stretches or icing to prevent pain</li>
      <li>Dislike bring the phone with me during the runs</li>
      <li>Wear less layers, it gets hot homie</li>
      <li>Get more sleep!</li>
    </ul>
