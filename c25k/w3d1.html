    Thoughts:
    <p>
      FUCK. That was hard. The first 3 minute run had me super winded. And the 2nd 3 minute run almost killed me. Legs are sore, lungs are bursting. I HAVE TO SLOW DOWN. :(
    </p>
    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I should slow down the pace of my jogs.</li>
      <li>Invest in a stopwatch instead of iPhone.</li>
      <li>Look into stretches or icing to prevent pain</li>
      <li>Dislike bring the phone with me during the runs</li>
      <li>Wear less layers, it gets hot homie</li>
      <li>Get more sleep!</li>
    </ul>
