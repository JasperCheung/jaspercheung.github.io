    Day: W7D1#2
    <br/><br/>
    For your 3 runs in week 7, you will begin with a brisk 5-minute walk, then 25 minutes of running.

    Thoughts:
    <p>
      Restarting week 7 since my ankle injury. Did a 12:30 run and a minute break and another 12:30 run. Not exactly 25 minutes straight but I'm going to count it.
    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I should slow down the pace of my jogs.</li>
      <li>Invest in a stopwatch instead of iPhone.</li>
      <li>Look into stretches or icing to prevent pain</li>
      <li>Dislike bring the phone with me during the runs</li>
      <li>Wear less layers, it gets hot homie</li>
      <li>Get more sleep!</li>
    </ul>
