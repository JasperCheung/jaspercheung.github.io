    Thoughts:
    <p>
      two rest days. BUT FINALLY FINISHED IT. YERRRRRRRRRR, did a 20 minute straight jog, i cannot believe it. I was out of breath as soon as i hit 8 minutes so i think my lung capacity or pace is still not optimal.
    </p>
    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I should slow down the pace of my jogs.</li>
      <li>Invest in a stopwatch instead of iPhone.</li>
      <li>Look into stretches or icing to prevent pain</li>
      <li>Dislike bring the phone with me during the runs</li>
      <li>Wear less layers, it gets hot homie</li>
      <li>Get more sleep!</li>
    </ul>
