    Day: W8D1
    <br/><br/>For your 3 runs in week 8, you will begin with a brisk 5-minute walk, then 28 minutes of running.

    Thoughts:
    <p>Ran around 28 minutes straight, again running out of breathe way too early. It also rained, running in the rain is nice but the clean up suckkkkks!</p>
    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I should slow down the pace of my jogs.</li>
      <li>Invest in a stopwatch instead of iPhone.</li>
      <li>Look into stretches or icing to prevent pain</li>
      <li>Dislike bring the phone with me during the runs</li>
      <li>Wear less layers, it gets hot homie</li>
      <li>Get more sleep!</li>
    </ul>
