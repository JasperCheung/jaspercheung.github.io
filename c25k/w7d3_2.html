    Day: W7D3#2(FAILED)
    <br/><br/>
    For your 3 runs in week 7, you will begin with a brisk 5-minute walk, then 25 minutes of running.

    Thoughts:
    <p>Ran 21 minutes. Failed again. I'm going to stick to this week until I hit 3 25 minutes w/o rest.</p>
      Notes:
      <ul>
        <li>I should slow down the pace of my jogs.</li>
        <li>Invest in a stopwatch instead of iPhone.</li>
        <li>Look into stretches or icing to prevent pain</li>
        <li>Dislike bring the phone with me during the runs</li>
        <li>Wear less layers, it gets hot homie</li>
        <li>Get more sleep!</li>
      </ul>
