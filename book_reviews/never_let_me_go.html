    Thoughts:
    <p>
      Really enjoyed their experiences at Hailsham. There was something about relationships, actions, consequences that occured in adolescence taken very seriously that I enjoyed. In a vaccum a lot of the "problems" or "conflicts" seem very childish, but to the charcters they were very impactful.
