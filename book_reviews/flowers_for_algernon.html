    Favorite Moments:
    <ul>
      <li> When Joe stands up for Charlie at the end of the book. Cried for the rest of the book.</li>
      <li> Intial meeting of Fay, very attractive. </li>
    </ul>
    Thoughts:
    <p>
     Read it in a day, getting my first COVID vaccine. Heartwrenching read. Probably the most emotional finishing a book I've ever felt.
