    Favorite Moments:
    <ul>
      <li> "They have literally nothing but the clothes on their backs. Literally was one of Lexie’s favourite words, which she deployed even when the situation was anything but literal. In this case, for once, it was more or less true."</li>
      <li> Moody and Pearls’s first meeting awww.</li>
      <li> pearl Asking Mia if she was wanted </li>
      <li> "He found himself daydreaming back to his own teenage years in Hong Kong, sneaking into the botanical gardens with Betsy Choy, those dreamlike afternoons he had never told anyone about, and had not remembered to relive, for many years. The young are always the same, always and everywhere" </li>

    Thoughts:
    <p>
      Really fun read. Loved the descriptions and imagery. Setences were charming and fun. Thought the plot was a weak point. Really had a visceral reaction towards Elena. Thought she was just evil. Book felt a little made-for-tv and episodic, didn't think it had the strongest ending.

      Intersting to learn about Shaker Heights, especially after reading Jane Jacobs.

      Very promeient and power female characters and leads. Now I know how it feels when girls read books. When the character that you relate to the most is Moody :(.
