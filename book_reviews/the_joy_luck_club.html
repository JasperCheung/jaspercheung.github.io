    Thoughts:

      First time reading an "Asian American" book. I see the appeal, there were chapters and stories that were incredibly relatable, almost to the point that it became uncanny. Book starts with the death of a mother and the first chapter made me incredibly emotional. The book ends with a strong resolution which also drew tears.

      It did feel a little too "packaged" every chapter ends with a deep quote etc. Overall, loved the book.
