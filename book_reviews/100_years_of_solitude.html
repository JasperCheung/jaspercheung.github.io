    Thoughts:
    <p>
      Really quick and enjoyable read for me. However, I definitely did not get to synthesize the important themes due to how fast I read. Have to revisit it someday. Smutty-ier than I would have expected. The pages of the first half of the novel flew by quickly, loved the descriptions and world-building early. I got a little bogged down when the deaths and patterns of tragedy started.
