    Thoughts:
    <p>
      I really enjoyed The Two Towers. Picking off after Fellowship’s incredibly strong ending. Two Towers places us almost directly in the action, Boromir’s death, Frodo and Sam’s departure, and Merry and Pippin’s kidnapping. We are left with the Legolas, Gimli, and Aragon trio.
