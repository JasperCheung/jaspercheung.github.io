    Favorite Moments:
    <ul>
      <li>Miss Crawford missing Edmond when he leaves for a week</li>
      <li>henry’s confession to fanny, i liked it better than pride and prejudice.</li>
      <li>fanny being flustered by it. end of 2nd volume was great.</li>
      <li>jane austen does confessions so well.</li>
      <li> Fanny being impressed by Crawfords good reading. i’m wet</li>
    </ul>
    Thoughts:
    <p>
      Really hard to get into. Did not like the first volume. Does get better and I was fully invested in the second volume. Austen does pursuing love and courting so well and Henry trying to win Fanny was my favorite part of the book.

      I was rooting for the Crawfords. I liked both of them. Really enjoyed the book overall, prefered it over Pride and Prejudice.
