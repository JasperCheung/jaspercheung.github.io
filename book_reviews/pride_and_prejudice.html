    Favorite Moments:
    <ul>
      <li> “In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.” - Darcy's first proposal </li>
      <li> "You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever." - Darcy's second proposal</li>
    </ul>
    Thoughts:
